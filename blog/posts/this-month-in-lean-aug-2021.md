d75799616a feat(analysis/complex): prove that complex functions are conformal if and only if the functions are holomorphic/antiholomorphic with nonvanishing differential (#8424)

f471b899c4 feat(topology,geometry/manifold): continuous and smooth partition of unity (#8281)
jmc: see also [continuous-partitions-of-unity] for details.

a0cb45fe4e feat(linear_algebra/clifford_algebra): the reals and complex numbers have isomorphic real clifford algebras (#8165)

894fb0c55f feat(data/nat/totient): totient_prime_pow (#8353)

7249afb24c feat(measure_theory/[integrable_on, set_integral]): integrals on two ae-eq sets are equal (#8440)

f961b28041 chore(deprecated/*): Make deprecated classes into structures (#8178)
jmc: massive PR by Kevin that does a technical refactor. Should this get its own blogpost?
